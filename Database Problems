177. Nth Highest Salary
Write an SQL query to report the nth highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no nth highest salary, the query should report null.
My solution 
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
Declare m INT; 
set m=n-1;

  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      Select salary
      From Employee
      Group by salary 
      order by salary Desc
      Limit m,1
      
  );
END
